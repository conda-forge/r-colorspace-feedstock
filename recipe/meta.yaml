  summary: 'Carries out mapping between assorted color spaces including RGB, HSV, HLS, CIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB and polar CIELAB. Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL colors are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette choice is aided by an interactive
    app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny GUI) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation functions include:
    desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly).'
